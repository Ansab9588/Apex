##The Apex class must be called ContactSearch and be in the public scope
The Apex class must have a public static method called searchForContacts
The method must accept two incoming strings as parameters

The method should finally return a list of Contact records of type List that includes the ID and Name fields
public class ContactSearch {
    public static List<Contact> searchForContacts(String lastName, String postalCode) {
        List<Contact> matchingContacts = new List<Contact>();

        // Query to find contacts with matching last name and postal code
        List<Contact> contacts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Contact WHERE LastName = :lastName AND MailingPostalCode = :postalCode];

        // Add matching contacts to the result list
        matchingContacts.addAll(contacts);

        return matchingContacts;
    }
}
